    - LLM basics (prompts, completions, tokens, temperature).
    - OpenAI API (authentication, models, endpoints).
    - Prompt engineering techniques.
    - Handling API responses and errors.
- **Project**:
    - Build a simple command-line chatbot using the OpenAI SDK.
    - Create a text summarization tool.
    - Experiment with different prompt strategies for a specific task (e.g., creative writing, code generation).

### Module 2: LangChain
- **Goal**: Master LLM application orchestration and build complex chains.
- **Topics**:
    - Core LangChain components (LLMs, Chains, Prompts, Indexes, Memory, Callbacks, Agents).
    - Document loading, splitting, and vector stores (e.g., FAISS, Chroma).
    - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
    - Building custom chains and agents.
- **Project**:
    - **PDF Research Assistant**: Load PDFs, create embeddings, and build a Q&A system over the documents.
    - **SQL Database Agent**: An agent that can query a SQL database based on natural language.
    - **Web Scraping & Summarization Chain**: A chain that scrapes a webpage and summarizes its content.

### Module 3: LangGraph
- **Goal**: Implement complex, stateful, and cyclical LLM workflows.
- **Topics**:
    - Understanding LangGraph concepts (Nodes, Edges, State).
    - Building multi-step agentic workflows.
    - Implementing conditional logic and cycles.
    - Error handling and persistence in graphs.
- **Project**:
    - Convert the LangChain PDF Research Assistant into a LangGraph application, allowing for more complex interactions (e.g., iterative refinement of answers).
    - **Multi-Agent Collaboration Workflow**: Design a graph where different agents (e.g., researcher, writer, reviewer) collaborate on a task.

### Module 4: Observability - LangSmith & LangFuse
- **Goal**: Learn to monitor, debug, and evaluate LLM applications.
- **LangSmith**:
    - **Topics**: Tracing LLM calls, debugging chains and agents, evaluating performance, creating datasets.
    - **Project**: Integrate LangSmith into your LangChain/LangGraph projects to trace execution, identify bottlenecks, and log interactions.
- **LangFuse**:
    - **Topics**: Analytics for LLM applications, cost tracking, user feedback collection, A/B testing prompts/models.
    - **Project**: Integrate LangFuse to monitor the PDF Research Assistant. Track query latency, user satisfaction (simulated), and costs. A/B test different embedding models or prompts.

### Module 5: Agentic AI - CrewAI
- **Goal**: Build and manage autonomous AI agents that collaborate to achieve complex goals.
- **Topics**:
    - CrewAI concepts (Agents, Tasks, Tools, Crews, Process).
    - Defining agent roles, goals, and backstories.
    - Creating custom tools for agents.
    - Sequential and hierarchical crew processes.
- **Project**:
    - **Market Analysis Crew**: Create a crew with agents for data collection (web scraping), data analysis, and report generation to analyze a specific market trend.
    - **Trip Planning Crew**: Agents that research destinations, find flights/hotels, and create an itinerary.

### Module 6: Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- **Goal**: Explore Google's ecosystem for building conversational agents, focusing on how its principles can apply to broader LLM development or its primary use cases.
- **Topics**:
    - Building conversational actions (e.g., for Google Assistant or similar platforms).
    - Integrating with external services and APIs.
    - Voice interaction design principles (if applicable).
- **Project**:
    - **Smart Information Kiosk Agent**: An agent that can answer questions about a specific domain (e.g., a museum, a product line) using information retrieved from a knowledge base.
    - **Personalized Task Manager**: An agent that helps users manage their tasks, set reminders, and integrate with calendar services.

### Module 7: Output Control & Validation - Pydantic AI & Agno
- **Goal**: Ensure reliable, structured, and safe LLM outputs.
- **Pydantic AI (or similar libraries like Instructor)**:
    - **Topics**: Defining output schemas using Pydantic models, forcing LLMs to generate JSON or other structured data, validation of LLM outputs.
    - **Project**: Refactor a LangChain or OpenAI SDK project to use Pydantic AI for structured output. For example, ensure a Q&A system always returns an answer and a list of source documents in a specific JSON format.
- **Agno (or other Guardrail libraries like Guardrails AI, Nemo Guardrails)**:
    - **Topics**: Implementing content moderation, topic guidance, factual consistency checks, preventing harmful outputs.
    - **Project**: Add Agno guardrails to your chatbot or PDF Research Assistant to prevent off-topic conversations, filter inappropriate content, or ensure answers are based on provided documents.

### Module 8: Capstone Project
- **Goal**: Integrate learnings into a single, comprehensive application.
- **Project Idea**: **"AI-Powered Content Creation Assistant"**
    - **Features**:
        - Takes a topic and target audience as input.
        - **Research Agent (CrewAI/LangGraph)**: Gathers information from the web and provided documents.
        - **Drafting Agent (LangChain/OpenAI SDK + Pydantic AI)**: Creates an initial draft based on research.
        - **Review & Editing Agent (LangGraph)**: Iteratively refines the draft, checks for factual accuracy, and ensures it meets style guidelines.
        - **Observability (LangSmith/LangFuse)**: Monitor the entire workflow.
        - **Guardrails (Agno)**: Ensure content is appropriate and on-topic.
    - **Interface**: Simple Streamlit or Flask web UI.

## üõ†Ô∏è General Tips for Learning
- **Hands-on is Key**: Prioritize coding and building over passive learning.
- **Start Small**: Tackle simple projects first to build confidence.
- **Read Documentation**: Official docs are your best friend.
- **Join Communities**: Engage in forums (e.g., LangChain Discord, Reddit r/LocalLLaMA).
- **Version Control**: Use Git for all your projects. Commit frequently.
- **Iterate**: Don't aim for perfection in the first go. Build, test, and refine.
- **Document Your Journey**: Keep notes, write blog posts, or share on GitHub.

## üóìÔ∏è Suggested Timeline (Flexible)
- **Module 1 (OpenAI SDK)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Module 2 (LangChain)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Module 3 (LangGraph)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Module 4 (LangSmith & LangFuse)**: 1-2 weeks (can be integrated alongside other modules)
- **Module 5 (CrewAI)**: 2 weeks
- **Module 6 (Google ADK)**: 1-2 weeks (adjust based on relevance and focus)
- **Module 7 (Pydantic AI & Agno)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Module 8 (Capstone Project)**: 3-4 weeks

This roadmap provides a structured approach. Feel free to adjust it based on your interests and learning pace. Good luck! üöÄ
